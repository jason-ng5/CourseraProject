'average.txt' contains the mean of all measurements' mean and standard deviation of each subject and each activity.  

# subject

  A number from 1-30 identifying the subject who performed the activities for the measurements obtained.  
  
# activity

  activity performed by the subject when the measurements were taken
    
    WALKING
    
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    
    SITTING
    
    STANDING
    
    LAYING

# Other Columns

The values under these columns contain the mean of the multiple measurements of 
the feature from the same subject performing the same activity.

e.g. first row of average.txt

"subject" "activity" "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" ...

1          "LAYING"     0.22159824394    ...

0.22159824394 is the mean of all measurements of "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" of subject 1 performing the activity "LAYING".
("tBodyAcc-mean()-X" is the mean of tBodyAcc on the x-axis.)
